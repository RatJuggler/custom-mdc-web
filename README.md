# custom-mdc-web

My custom MDC Web. 

See [MDC Web](https://material.io/develop/web/) and the [Getting Started](https://material.io/develop/web/docs/getting-started/).

- Use `npm start` to start a webpack development instance.
- Use `npm run build` to build css/js development bundles (not production ready).
